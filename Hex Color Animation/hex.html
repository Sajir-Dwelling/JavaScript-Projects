            <h1>So what i am gonna do is to change the background color thrpugh animation.
            it's a tutorial so do check out the code in my github account😺</h1>
            <p>So what I've used are like some simple html tags like header and paragraphs and button.
            Then in css, I've used like a bunch of elements, most of them were simple but the matter was with keyframe animations, media query. But in the end, it wasnt that tough.
            <br>So the color change is <span id="change_background">#393E46</span></p>
            <button id="first-button" onclick="change_color()">Click ME!</button>
            <button id="second-button" onclick="reset_web()">Reset</button>
